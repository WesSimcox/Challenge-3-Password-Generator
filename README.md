# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description:

**JS Arrays**: I began with creating 4 seperate arrays to store the data that I wanted to include in the password generation. For example, I create an array of just lowercase letters so that when the password was generated it would randomly select a lowercase letter to fill a spot in the password.

**ValidChoices**: For the validChoices, it was used to store the preferences for generating a password and what arrays to use in said generation. For example, if I decide I did not want any lowercase letters, when I select no lowercase letters it would be excluded from possible arrays to pull characters from in password generation.

**Password Generation Logic**:The password generation logic uses the Math.random funciton and pulls from the validChoices you randomly choose characters from the specified data sets chosen.
